THIS IS A CURATION/ORGANIZATION PHASE.

The user asked us to prepare implementation context for:

---

USER PROMPT: **{{PROMPT}}**

---

{{DYNAMIC_CONTEXT}}

## Workflow

1. Consolidate recent research findings from `synth-forum`.
2. Curate and organize `synth-issue` tasks/dependencies for implementation readiness.
3. Prioritize leaf issues, define acceptance criteria, and identify blockers.
4. Record decisions, references, and open questions to `synth-forum`.
5. Ensure issue graph is actionable for a later `--mode implementation` run.

Do NOT implement production code in this phase.
