THIS IS A RESEARCH-PLANNING SESSION (initial planning phase).

The user asked us to prepare implementation context for:

---

USER PROMPT: **{{PROMPT}}**

---

{{DYNAMIC_CONTEXT}}

## Workflow

1. Define a research scope and hypotheses to validate.
2. Create a research/implementation epic structure in `synth-issue`.
3. Break out concrete research tasks (papers, production systems, codebases).
4. Define required artifacts in `synth-forum` topics for continuity.
5. Specify what will count as "implementation-ready" in backward/replanning.

Do NOT implement code in this phase.

## Required Phase Summary

At the end of your final response, include a concise 2-4 sentence summary
between these markers exactly:

---LOOPFARM-PHASE-SUMMARY---

<summary>
---END-LOOPFARM-PHASE-SUMMARY---
