THIS IS A DEEP RESEARCH PHASE.

The user asked us to prepare implementation context for:

---

USER PROMPT: **{{PROMPT}}**

---

{{DYNAMIC_CONTEXT}}

## Workflow

1. Perform deep research using `vecky`, web search, papers, and production systems.
2. Clone and study relevant external repositories when needed.
3. Extract concrete findings: architecture patterns, performance tradeoffs, failure modes.
4. Capture findings in `synth-forum` topics for durable context.
5. Link findings to `synth-issue` tasks under the active research/implementation epic.

Do NOT implement production code in this phase.
